# Chess
I'm currently working on this Chess app, written in C++ with rendering handled in OpenGL. You can get a sense for my workflow and current progress by looking at the trello board I use for this project at https://trello.com/b/t6SrmE43/chess-app.

## Planned Features
- Human v Human
- Human v CPU (Rudimentary AI)
- Timed games
- Ability to rewind moves
- Improved AI
- Maybe an AI helper / move suggestions
