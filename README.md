# Chess
I'm currently working on this Chess app, written in C++ with rendering handled in OpenGL. You can get a sense for my workflow and current progress by looking at the trello board I use for this project at https://trello.com/b/t6SrmE43/chess-app.

## Why Chess?
Firstly, I enjoy Chess. I'm by no means good at it, but it's a very complex game which rewards intuition and pattern recognition, which presents a decent level of challenge for anyone trying to write an AI player. It's also a turn based game, which lends itself to an event-driven game loop, a style of program I haven't had much experience in writing. The rendering and visuals are simple enough that the bulk of my focus can be on writing the actual game logic, while still leaving scope for me to work on UI and test out different design choices.
